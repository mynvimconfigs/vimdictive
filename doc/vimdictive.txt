 1. INTRODUCTION                                            *vimdictive-intro*

Vimdictive provides dict.org compatible dictionary and thesaurus lookups
within Vim, showing the results in a |preview-window|. With dictionary
meanings, synonyms & antonyms and regular expression and rhyme filters,
Vimdictive is intended to assist in the selection of the choicest words when
writing prose.

Vimdictive Browser Maps~                             *vimdictive-browser-maps*

The Vimdictive browser is a Vim preview-window with the following maps:

* <enter>     Show the meanings of the word under the cursor.
* <backspace> Show the synonyms (and antonyms) of the word under the cursor.
* q           Close the Vimdictive browser (window).
* <F5>        Refresh the browser with the most recent query results.

Vimdictive Global Maps~                               *vimdictive-global-maps*

Pressing <leader>dm from any buffer within Vim will open the Vimdictive
browser with the meanings of the word under the cursor.  Likewise, <leader>ds
will show the synonyms (and antonyms) of that word. The synonym list can be
filtered by a regular expression and by rhyme. So, for example, you can show
the synonyms of the word "call" that rhyme with the word "pray" and that match
the regex /^b/ (that is, start with the letter "b").

The global Vimdictive commands and their default key-maps are:

* Show meanings of word under cursor.
  Default Key: <leader>dm
  Override Plug Map: <Plug>vimdictive_meanings

* Show synonyms of word under cursor.
  Default Key: <leader>ds
  Override Plug Map: <Plug>vimdictive_synonyms

* Set the synonym regex filter.
  Default Key: <leader>df
  Override Plug Map: <Plug>vimdictive_filter

* Set the synonym rhyme filter.
  Default Key: <leader>dr
  Override Plug Map: <Plug>vimdictive_filter_rhyme

You can override these keymaps in your |$MYVIMRC| with lines like: >

  nmap <F2> <Plug>vimdictive_meanings

<

 2. STATUSLINE                                         *vimdictive-statusline*

The Vimdictive browser window uses a statusline of the following format:

  vimdictive:[TYPE:/REGEX/{RHYME}:'WORD'] [0% line 1 of 2]

Where:

-  TYPE  : 'M' for meanings, 'S' for synonyms.
-  REGEX : The current regular expression for filtering synonyms.
-  RHYME : The current rhyming word for filtering synonyms.
-  WORD  : The current dictionary term.

The REGEX and RHYME are only visible when in Synonym mode.

==============================================================================
 3. CONFIGURATION                                   *vimdictive-configuration*

By default, Vimdictive accesses http://dict.org/ for dictionary and
thesaurus lookups. You can customise this with a setting in your
|$MYVIMRC| like:>

  let vimdictive_dicts = {
        \ 'dictionary' : ['localhost', ['gcide']],
        \ 'thesaurus' : ['localhost', ['moby-thesaurus']]
        \ }
<

==============================================================================
 4. EXTERNAL DEPENDENCIES                   *vimdictive-external-dependencies*
